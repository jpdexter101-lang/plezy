/**
 * Random-access byte source for the libavformat demuxer.
 *
 * libavformat demuxers own their own IO: they jump to the end of the file for an
 * index (matroska Cues, MP4 moov, AVI idx1), back to the header, and binary
 * search (MPEG-PS) whenever they please. media3's [
 * androidx.media3.extractor.ExtractorInput] is forward-only — an extractor may
 * only ask the loader to re-open elsewhere and be invoked again — so serving
 * libavformat from the loader alone means every backward jump has to unwind the
 * in-flight libavformat call and replay it, which is what the demuxer shim used
 * to do (and what made a matroska Cues read unrecoverable, #2096).
 *
 * This class removes the mismatch instead of working around it: reads outside
 * the loader's window open a second [DataSource] from the same factory media3
 * uses, positioned exactly where libavformat asked. Cronet, download caches,
 * SAF and the item's own request headers therefore still apply, because the
 * [DataSpec] is cloned from the one media3 opened for this item.
 *
 * Sequential sample delivery deliberately does not come through here: it stays
 * on the loader's connection so media3 keeps its byte accounting, back-pressure
 * and load-error policy (see [FfmpegExtractor]). This source is opened for
 * header/index bursts and closed again as soon as the loader is back in step.
